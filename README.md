# taskBank

A full stack web development project. It includes a comprehensive task management tool that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks and deadlines. We implemented a task management API to store and retrieve task information and included user interactive features such as creating a new task, manage existing tasks, and displaying tasks in chronological order/priority.
